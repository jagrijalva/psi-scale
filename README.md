# Power-Sharing Index (PSI): Validation & Methodology

This repository contains the documentation and validation framework for the **Power-Sharing Index (PSI)**. The PSI is a longitudinal measure designed to track cross-group power-sharing and inclusive governance from 1789 to the present.

## 1. Conceptualization & Variable Selection
The PSI defines power-sharing as the substantive inclusion of diverse groups in the political process. Five items were selected from the **V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy)** dataset based on three criteria:
* **Temporal Depth:** Continuous data from 1789 to the present.
* **Historical Sensitivity:** Ability to accurately score the low inclusivity of the *Herrenvolk* era.
* **Distinct Mechanisms:** Capturing unique facets of exclusion.

### Core Components
| Variable | Mechanism Captured |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Group Power** | Distribution of political power among social groups. |
| **Gender** | Women's political empowerment and inclusion. |
| **Civil Liberties Equality** | Equal protection of rights across different groups. |
| **Physical Integrity (Torture)** | Freedom from state-sponsored torture. |
| **Physical Integrity (Killings)** | Freedom from political killings. |

> **Note:** Variables such as *Suffrage* were excluded because they lacked historical coverage back to 1789 or failed to capture non-electoral nuances of exclusion.

## 2. Internal Structure & Reliability
Statistical testing confirms that the PSI components measure a single, cohesive underlying construct.



* **Inter-item Correlation:** All items show high synergy (> 0.60).
* **Cronbach’s Alpha:** ≈ 0.96, indicating exceptional internal reliability.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PC1 explains **87.4%** of the variance, with high loadings across all components.
* **KMO Measure:** ≈ 0.79, confirming "good" sampling adequacy for factor analysis.

## 3. External Validity
The PSI’s performance was benchmarked against historical eras to confirm **discriminant, convergent, and construct validity**.

### Historical Benchmarking
* **The Herrenvolk Paradox (1789–1899):** The PSI shows a negative correlation with Electoral Democracy, identifying that early democratic expansions often coexisted with deep group exclusion.
* **Modern Convergence:** Strong positive correlations with V-Dem indices post-1965.
* **Event Sensitivity:** The index reflects documented shifts around the **19th Amendment**, the **Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)**, and the **Shelby County v. Holder (2013)** decision.

## 4. Aggregation & Sensitivity Analysis
To ensure the index is not dependent on a specific mathematical formula, we tested multiple aggregation methods:

1. **Comparison:** Additive, Multiplicative, and Hybrid methods were compared; all yielded consistent temporal patterns.
